 7. Serve the application
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

 ## Common Artisan Commands
 - Run server: `php artisan serve`
 - Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
 - Rollback last migration: `php artisan migrate:rollback`
 - Seed all dev data: `php artisan db:seed`
 - Fresh DB (drop all, migrate, seed): `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
 
 ## Notes

 - You may adjust or extend the seeders in `database/seeders/` to fit your development needs.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
